# Authentication and Authorization with JWT in Spring Framework 6 using Hexagonal Architecture

This project aims to perform user authentication and authorization using JsonWebToken using Spring Boot 3 & 
Spring Security 6 using Hexagonal Architecture to make this project easy to grow. Also, it uses Lombok library for
dependency injection and Mapstruct to map objects between infrastructure layer and application layer.

## How to run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
* Run `docker-compose up -d` on root project
* Create a database named `login_db`
* If you want to use `qa` profile, create a database named `qa_db`. The tables of this database are defined in `src/main/resources/qa/schema.sql`
* Create all the tables inside the database using the querys in `<project_root>/SQL_tables_querys.txt` file
* Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` on root project

## Features üî¨
